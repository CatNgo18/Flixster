### Notes

Part 2 went by a lot smoother than part 1, but there were a lot of new concepts to learn.

## Open-source libraries used
- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Android

## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [ ] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [ ] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [ ] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

When I first implemented AsynchHttpClient, I kept getting errors and the app wouldn't load. I checked the Slack to see if anyone else had the same problem and lucky for me, I found a solution.
However, the solution didn't work for me at first for some reason so I had to load up a lot of backups but in the end, I was able to get it.

Also, while watching the video walkthroughs, I felt like so much information was being given to me so quickly and it was really overwhelming.
While I understood some things as I have developed a webapp before, the combination of the fast pace and my lack of knowledge of Java made the whole task more difficult that it would have been if I had been more familiar with Java.
